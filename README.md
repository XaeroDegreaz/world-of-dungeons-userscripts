A compilation of user scripts for the web game [World of Dungeons](http://world-of-dungeons.net/onlinegame/ed/97771)

### Hero Switcher Dropdown
Adds a dropdown to the top of the screen to easily switch between multiple characters with a single click.
It remembers the pages you're on, so this is really useful when wanting to switch between users on things like storage / cellar, etc.
